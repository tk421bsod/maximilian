Hi. This is where Maximilian's optional modules are stored.  
Each module here provides a set of functions in the form of commands.  
None are interdependent, so you can add/remove functionality at will without breaking anything.  
Use the `utils reload` command to reload modules and avoid a full restart.  
Use `utils load` to load modules on demand.  
Use `utils unload` to unload modules on demand.
