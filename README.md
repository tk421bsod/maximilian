# maximilian

A Discord bot with some cool features that does some cool stuff.
Currently in active development.

This branch is used for development of the next major version, 1.0.

## why do most commits say they're from 2020?

I did a rebase to remove personal information from the vast majority of commits.
In the process, I forgot to set $GIT_COMMITTER_DATE, the value GitHub uses to track commit dates.
Commit dates should still show correctly when using `git log`.
