This branch is a snapshot of 0.6.3, the last release before 1.0.
It probably won't change.

This version may stop working soon as it requires an old version of discord.py to function.
If you're using this, consider switching to the `release` branch. 
If you absolutely need to use this, please let me know through Discord. (`tk421#2016`)
