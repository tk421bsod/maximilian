# maximilian

An easy to use Discord bot written in Python.
This branch will be used for active development of Maximilian 1.0, starting after the next release.

This branch is a snapshot of 0.6.3.
It probably won't change.

This version may stop working soon as it requires an old version of discord.py to function.
If you're using this, consider switching to 1.0.
