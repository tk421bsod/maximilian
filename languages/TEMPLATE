PRIVACY_TITLE:Maximilian Privacy Policy
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTION_TITLE:Why Maximilian collects data
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTION:Maximilian accesses/stores certain information that is necessary for certain functions. It doesn't collect any sort of personally identifiable information. (types of data collected are described below)
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_TITLE:Data that Maximilian stores
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_SERVER_IDS:**-Server IDs**\nMaximilian stores server IDs when you create a custom command, add a reaction role, or change its prefix to distinguish between different servers.
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_ROLE_IDS_TITLE:-Role IDs
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_ROLE_IDS:Maximilian stores role IDs whenever you add a reaction role so it can give people the correct role.
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_USER_IDS_TITLE:-User IDs
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_USER_IDS:Maximilian stores user IDs so it can keep track of todo lists and active reminders.
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_MUSIC_TITLE:-Music
PRIVACY_DATA_COLLECTED_MUSIC:To keep track of what channels it's playing audio in, Maximilian puts your voice channel's ID in a list temporarily. This data isn't retrievable by anyone, and your channel ID is removed from the list when Maximilian stops playing audio in your server. When you play a song, Maximilian stores information about that song, like the video ID and name, so it can be played without a long delay next time. When you add a song to your queue, Maximilian temporarily stores your voice channel's ID, the song's position in the queue, the song's name, and the song's id to keep track of your queue.
PRIVACY_DELETION_HELP_TITLE:I want to delete my server's data, how do I request that?
PRIVACY_DELETION_HELP:You can delete all the data in your server by using `{}deleteall`. This will irreversibly delete all of the reaction roles and custom commands you have set up and reset the prefix to the default of `!`. Only people with the administrator permission can use this.
ROLEMEMBERS:Found {} users with the {} role. \n{}
MEMBERCOUNT:Found {} members. ({} people and {} bots.)
SOURCE_NOT_FOUND:I can't find the source code for that command. Make sure you didn't misspell the command's name.
ABOUT_TITLE:About
ABOUT_SUMMARY_TITLE:What's Maximilian?
ABOUT_SUMMARY_TEXT:Quite a few things. In short, it's a versatile, multi-purpose bot.
ABOUT_HELP_TITLE:Useful stuff
ABOUT_HELP_TEXT:Use `{}help command` for more info on a certain command. \n For more help, join the support server at https://discord.gg/PJ94gft. \n To add Maximilian to your server, with only the required permissions, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=620022782016618528&permissions=335923264&scope=bot). \nIf you want to contribute to my development, visit my Github repository at https://github.com/tk421bsod/maximilian.
